# High Level Context
## context
This code file represents a React component for a player resources page. It uses Next.js and React hooks to fetch and display a list of PDF files from an S3 bucket. The component does the following:

1. Fetches PDF files from S3 using the listPlayerContents function
2. Filters and sorts the files, keeping only PDFs without underscores in their names
3. Renders a list of links to the PDF files, with each link leading to a dynamic route
4. Uses client-side rendering with the 'use client' directive
5. Implements error handling and a loading state
6. Applies basic styling using Tailwind CSS classes

The component creates a user interface for players to access various PDF resources, likely related to a game or application.

# PlayerPage app/player/page.tsx
## Imported Code Object
In this code snippet, PlayerPage is a functional React component that represents a page displaying player resources. Here's a concise explanation of its functionality:

1. It fetches a list of PDF files from a remote source using the `listPlayerContents` function.
2. It filters and sorts the files, keeping only PDFs without underscores in their names.
3. The component renders a list of links to these PDF files.
4. Each link uses the filename (without extension) as the display text and a modified version of the filename (with spaces replaced by underscores) in the URL.
5. While loading, it displays a "loading..." message.
6. The page title is "Player Resources" (note: there's a typo in the original code).

This component is likely used to present a list of downloadable PDF resources for players in some kind of application or game.

### Third Party Libaries

Based on the provided code, the PlayerPage component does not directly use any third-party APIs or libraries. It primarily uses React hooks (useState and useEffect) and custom functions (listPlayerContents). The Link component is likely from a routing library, but it's not a third-party API in the traditional sense.

### Security Issues

The main security concern in this code is the potential for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks if the file names retrieved from the server are not properly sanitized before being rendered in the DOM, especially when used in the Link component's href attribute.
