# High Level Context
## context
This code file represents a React component for a player resources page. It uses Next.js and React hooks to fetch and display a list of PDF files from an S3 bucket. The component does the following:

1. Fetches PDF files from S3 using the listPlayerContents function
2. Filters and sorts the files, keeping only PDFs without underscores in their names
3. Renders a list of links to the PDF files, with each link leading to a dynamic route
4. Uses client-side rendering with the 'use client' directive
5. Implements error handling and a loading state
6. Applies basic styling using Tailwind CSS classes

The component creates a user interface for players to access various PDF resources, likely related to a game or application.

# PlayerPage app/player/page.tsx
## Imported Code Object
PlayerPage is a React functional component that displays a list of player resources (PDF files) fetched from a server. Here's a concise explanation of its functionality:

1. It uses the useState hook to manage the state of files.
2. The useEffect hook is used to fetch files asynchronously when the component mounts.
3. It filters and sorts the fetched files, keeping only PDFs without underscores in their names.
4. The component renders a title "Player Resources" and a list of file links.
5. Each file link is created using the renderFile function, which formats the file name and creates a Link component.
6. If no files are loaded yet, it displays a "loading..." message.
7. The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling.

In summary, PlayerPage is responsible for fetching, processing, and displaying a list of player resource files as clickable links.
